# Louise's Fundraising Data

## Summary:

### Louise contacted us about her fundraising goal for her play. She wanted us to gather data based upon launch dates and funding goals to see how they fared. She had a fundraising goal of ten thousand dollars for her play *Fever*. Louise's play came close to its goal in a short time and now she she wants a visualization of different campains so that she may have a more succesful fundraising in the future.


## Analysis

### I took the origanal kickstarter sheet and labeled it outcomes based on goals. In a new sheet i created new columns of data for Louise's information she requested. I then gathered the goal,failed,canceled data. I then got the total number of projects. Afterwords i gathered the successful,failed,canceled percentages based on years. Once all the data was collected i created a pivot chart for all the information gathered
